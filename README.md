This project implements an unsupervised anomaly detection approach to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using a Deep Autoencoder built with Keras and TensorFlow.
The model is trained exclusively on normal transactions to learn their patterns, and fraud detection is performed by measuring reconstruction error. Transactions with an error above a chosen threshold are flagged as potential frauds.

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Description: Transactions made by European cardholders over two days, with:

284,807 total transactions

492 frauds (~0.172% of dataset — highly imbalanced)

Features:

Numerical, mostly PCA-transformed for privacy

Time — seconds since first transaction

Amount — transaction amount

Class — 0 = Normal, 1 = Fraud

🛠️ Technologies Used
Languages: Python

Libraries:

Data Processing: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Deep Learning: Keras (with TensorFlow backend)

⚙️ Approach
Data Preprocessing

Dropped Time column

Standardized Amount using StandardScaler

Split data into train (only normal transactions) and test sets

Model Architecture

Input Layer: 29 neurons

Encoder: Dense(14, tanh, L1 regularization) → Dense(7, relu)

Decoder: Dense(7, tanh) → Dense(29, relu)

Loss: Mean Squared Error

Optimizer: Adam

Training

100 epochs, batch size = 32

Used ModelCheckpoint to save the best model

TensorBoard logging for monitoring

Evaluation

Calculated reconstruction error

Determined threshold for fraud detection

Evaluated with Confusion Matrix, ROC curve, Precision-Recall curve

📊 Results
ROC AUC: High separation between normal and fraud transactions

Precision-Recall Trade-off:

Higher threshold → higher precision, lower recall

Lower threshold → higher recall, lower precision

Model flagged most fraud cases but also produced false positives (normal transactions predicted as fraud)

📌 Key Insights
Autoencoders can effectively learn the structure of normal data and detect anomalies.

Proper threshold tuning is crucial to balance between false positives and missed frauds.

The model works best when fraud patterns are significantly different from normal patterns.
